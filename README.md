### Reservations

### Create a new reservation
You can create a new reservation by clicking on ```+ New Reservation``` on the top of the page, or by clicking on the ```+``` next to the reservations list. Each reservation requires a first name, last name, phone number, party size, reservation time, and reservation date.

> Trying to create a reservation with an empty feild, at a date in the past, after the restaurant closes, or less than an hour before the restaurant closes will return an error.

### Seat a reservation
To seat a reservation, click on the ```Seat``` button on the bottom of the reservation card. This will bring you to the Seat Table page where you can select a table.

After seating the reservation, the table status will be updated to "Occupied" and the reservation status will be updated to "Seated"

> If the party size on the reservation is too big for a certain table, the option for that table will be disabled on the dropdown list.
